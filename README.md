# Kirby Responsive Images

A simple drop-in implementation of [responsive images](https://responsiveimages.org/) for Kirby CMS. Automatically generates thumbnails for low-resolution devices.

## Installation

[Download the latest release](https://github.com/jancbeck/kirby-responsive-images/releases/) and unpack to your kirby `/site/tags` directory.

Alternatively you can:
``git clone https://github.com/jancbeck/kirby-responsive-images.git site/tags/kirby-responsive-images``
From the root of your kirby install. Then you have to create a ``responsiveimage.php`` inside your ``site/tags`` with following content:

```
<?php
require_once('kirby-responsive-images/responsiveimage.php');
``

## Usage

There nothing you need to change in order to have responsive image support. Just include images as you would do normally:

`(responsiveimage:workflow@3x.jpg link:workflow@3x.jpg width:1244)`

Make sure your `/thumbs` directory is present and writable and ImageMagick is available.

Although the plugin works without configuration, these options are available and can be added to your `/site/config/config.php`:

### Sizes

To control the sizes attribute you can use [media queries](https://ericportis.com/posts/2014/srcset-sizes/).

```
<?php
c::set('responsiveimages.sizes', array( 
    array(
        'size_value' => '10em',
        'mq_value'   => '60em',
        'mq_name'    => 'min-width'
    ),
    array(
        'size_value' => '$img_width',
        'mq_value'   => '30em',
        'mq_name'    => 'min-width'
    ),
    'alignleft' => array(
        'size_value' => 'calc(50vw - 30px)'
    ),
));
```

1. `$img_width` is a placeholder that will be replaced by the images actual pixel width.
2. The array key will be matched against the `classes` attribute of the image. In the example above `'size_value' => 'calc(50vw - 30px)'` will only be added if the image has the `alignleft` attribute.

### Sources

By default, the plugin will generate thumbnails that are 480, 768 and 1200 pixels wide. You can overwrite these settings like these: 

```
<?php
c::set('responsiveimages.sources', array( 
    'small'  => array('width' => 444),
    'medium' => array('width' => 666),
    'large'  => array('width' => 999, 'grayscale' => true) // good for debugging
));
```

1. The key names are optional and have no technical implications.
2. Each array item takes the same arguments as Kirbys [thumb()](http://getkirby.com/docs/cheatsheet/helpers/thumb) function (`quality`, `blur`, `upscale` etc..).

### Scale

You can also use the `usescale` option to create a scale based srcset. It will take the name of the file as reference to auto generate the other scales.
`workflow@3x.jpg` will create a srcset with a `3x`, `2x` and `1x` entry.

`(responsiveimage:workflow@3x.jpg usescale:true)`

It's important to define the correct basescale with the `@â€¦x` pattern in your filename.

scale and sizes can't be mixed see: [Stackoverlow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26928828/html5-srcset-mixing-x-and-w-syntax/26937237#26937237)

### Template usage

You can use the responsive image tag directly in you template using the [Kirbytag](http://getkirby.com/docs/cheatsheet/helpers/kirbytag) helper function: 

```
<?php echo kirbytag(array('responsiveimage' => 'workflow@3x.jpg', 'link' => 'workflow@3x.jpg', 'width' => 1244)); ?>
```
